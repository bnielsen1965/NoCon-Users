# NoCon\Users Samples

This directory contains sample files and code used to demonstrate the use of 
the NoCon Users classes.


## sql

The sql directory contains SQL samples used to create and initialize a database
for NoCon\Users. The samples may work out of the box on your data store or you
may need to adjust the SQL for the unique requirements of your database.


## config

User data is stored in a database and the config directory contains a sample
configuration for the database. The class uses PHP PDO and will require a valid
dsn, username, and password for your data store.


## view

The view directory contains sample views that demonstrate how to use the package 
in your application. Note that these samples are not production worthy code, they 
are provided only for demonstration purposes. Use good coding practices when you
create your own implementation.
